# Persistence-Management
Persistence management ensures data durability and accessibility. The Hibernate Framework, a prominent solution in this domain, simplifies the process of persisting Java objects to relational databases. By providing an object-relational mapping (ORM) mechanism, Hibernate bridges the gap between object-oriented programming and database interaction.
